This is an introduction post!
Oh well I guess one can't stat a blog without some kind of introduction. 
I'm software developer, a husband, a dad and a lot of other stuff. I really enjoy working in technology and I truly get thrilled when diving into new shiny languages, frameworks and tools. 

I'm starting this blog because I want to archive some my thoughts and programming experiments. Who know it might be useful later.

Stay tuned!
