I am a Danish full stack software developer and architect with 10y+ experience. I do web, security cross-platform mobile development and everything in-between. I am known to be a person who challenges the well-known with a positive mind, both when it comes to building solutions, improving the development process and choosing platform, language or technology. I am inspired by functional programming languages, which is reflected in my approach to programming and I strive to become a polyglot devel- oper. Privately I am a father of two boys and a girl, married to a sociologist doing UX Research. We live in Copenhagen, but are often hanging out in our Kolonihave (Wooden hut), where we relax, build new stuff out of old stuff and try to make plants grow.
