###Giving GitKrakken a go.

Well I have had it installed for some months now, not really giving it a go. But about 2 weeks ago I decided to give it a proper testdrive. 
I like having a visual tool to provide me with some more overview than can be provided though the command line and i have been using [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for that the last few years. It's a great and really powerfull tool that has helped me quite a bit in difficult situations. But it is rather slow, thus I tend to user command line for most operations and have SourceTree provide overview.

###What i like about it
* X-plat (based on [electron]() - i work on both mac and windows, nice to have a familia experience
* fast
* Simple when you get the hang of it
* Dark theme - yeah really!
* easy amend
* pull rebase (screenshot)
* Pull requests if origin supports it

###Short commings
* I really miss the ability to use custom diff tool. The build in is not bad, but things 3-way merge with Beyond Compare is priceless!
* No support for 2fa?
* interactive rebase (https://twitter.com/gitkraken/status/684543513166352384)
* ?

###In conslusion
* Since I haven't had SourceTree open the last 4 weeks I'm probably stick to it and handle the shortcommings through the terminal.
